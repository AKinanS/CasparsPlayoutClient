ToDo:

CORE:
=====

- Change Playlists to work with Events instead of waiting in Threads
There are 5 events:
	1. Stopped --> The Playlist has stopped playing
	2. Started --> The Playlist has started playing
	3. Paused --> The Playlist has paused playing
	4. Changed --> The Playlists parameter has been changed (i.e. duration, type etc.)
	5. Canceled --> The Playlists canceled an action like play/stop/pause for some given reason. 
Each Playlist is handler for it's child items and may be for it's self.
Example msg flow (PL = Playlist, SPL = SubPlaylist):
	PL1 --	SPL1
			SPL2

	PL1.play():		--> PL1.started
					<-- PL1.started*
					SPL1.play()
	SPL1.play():	--> SPL1.started
					<-- SPL1.started*
	PL1:			<-- SPL1.started
	...
	PL1.pause():	--> PL1.paused
					<-- PL1.paused*
					SPL1.pause()
					SPL2.pause()
	SPL1.pause():	--> SPL1.paused
					<-- SPL1.paused*
	SPL2.pause():	--> SPL2.paused
					<-- SPL2.paused*
					---> SPL2.canceled(pause, NOT PLAYING)
	PL1:			<-- SPL1.paused
					<-- SPL2.paused
					<-- SPL2.canceled(pause, NOT PLAYING)
	PL1.unpause():	--> PL1.started()
					<-- PL1.started()*
					SPL1.unpause()
	SPL1.unpause(): --> SPL1.started
					<-- SPL1.started*
	PL1:			<-- SPL1.started
	...
	SPL1:			--> SPL1.stopped
					<-- SPL1.stopped*
	PL1:			<-- SPL1.stopped
					SPL2.play()
	.....
	.....

* = The playlist starts to play/pause etc. after receiving it's own event! So .play() only send events. 
This way, we make sure that we handle everything in the right thread.
